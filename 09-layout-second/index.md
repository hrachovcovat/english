# Visual identity of a company Glamping Pyskočely

## Abstract
By redesigning an identity for Glamping Pyskočely I would like to spread the word 'glamping' to more people and point out that camping can be done in another, more comfortable way. Also with a new identity I would like to express the right mood of this company.

#### Brand name
Original name of the company is **'Glamping Pyskočely'**. I changed the name to **'Mezi buky'**. Translation to english is something like 'among the beech trees'.
In colony where the accommodation lies are more than 250 years old beeches. I wanted to express the nature also in the name because like we know, almost nobody knows the word glamping and people can't connect it with nature. So I decided not to use this word and express it in a different way.

#### Logo?? for an opinion-_-
