# Visual identity of a company Glamping Pyskočely

## Abstract
By redesigning an identity for Glamping Pyskočely I would like to spread the word 'glamping' to more people and point out that camping can be done in another, more comfortable way. Also with a new identity I would like to express the right mood of this company.

## Keywords

## Presentation
Glamping Pyskočely – visual identity
#### Brief history of the glamping:
> The word glamping appeared in English around 2005, in the Oxford Dictionary in 2016. However, the history of glamping dates back to the time when European kings didn't sleep in a tent on the ground during trips to diplomatic meetings and military expeditions. 

During the meeting of Henry VIII. and Francis I. in the north of France were build about 2,800 tents, some were decorated with gold, red wine and beer flowed from the fountains around and Henry's tent had an area of about ten thousand square meters. Also the Ottomans took a group of craftsmen on military missions to take care of the construction of their palace tents.

The nomadic tribes lived in yurts, circular tents providing protection from strong winds. The yurts were made of light material and construction, so they were easy to carry so it allowed the tribes to move according to their needs.

Glamping was also fueled by the event in 1903, when President Theodore Roosevelt went on a trip with conservationist John Muir to Yosemite National Park, which popularized camping.

#### Brand name
> Original name of the company is **'Glamping Pyskočely'**. 

I changed the name to **'Mezi buky'**. Translation to english is something like 'among the beech trees'.
In colony where the accommodation lies are more than 250 years old beeches. I wanted to express the nature also in the name because like we know, almost nobody knows the word glamping and people can't connect it with nature. So I decided not to use this word and express it in a different way.

#### Logo?? for an opinion-_-
