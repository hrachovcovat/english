## My story
Photo of me?

In my whole life I have never been really sure about my future. The first notification came when I had to decide what high school I want to study. I don't remember the exact decision but 
I have always been the person who is staying beyond the camera, not in the viewfinder. So I decided to study a photography and it was a good choice because I fell in love with analog photography.
Then (again) came another moment when I had to decide what to do next. I started study a one year language course of english.
And here we are again, after the finishing the english course the crazy sign in my head 'loading your decision...' showed up.

So now I am here, studying third and last year of graphic design at VŠKK, telling myself what the f are u doing here. Thinking about what if I don't belong in here.
But you know what? Maybe life is also about not knowing. Seeking the right way for us. And I can finally say outloud that it's not wrong to not find it. 

And what I enjoy to do? I like a book design, making a macrame decorations and I am trying to reduce the waste I produce as a human.

And that's my story.
