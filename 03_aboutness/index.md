Hey, I am Tereza
Single sentence about me as a designer
## My story
Photo of me?
In my whole life I have never been really sure about my future. The first notification came when I had to decide what high school I want to study. I don't remember the exact decision but 
I have always been the person who is staying beyond the camera, not in the viewfinder.
Then (again) came the moment I have
Crazy sign in my head wasting for the decision.. loading.. haha.

And now? I am here studying third and last year a graphic design at VŠKK, telling myself what the f are u doing here?
But you now what? Maybe life is also about not knowing. Finding the right way for us. And I can finally say outloud that it's not wrong to not find it. 

And that's my story.
