## About me 
Hey, I am Tereza
Single sentence about me as a designer
## My story
Photo of me?
In my whole life I have never been really sure about my future.
I have always been the person who is staying beyond the camera, not in the viewfinder.
And now? I am here studying third and last year a graphic design at VŠKK, telling myself what the f are u doing here?
But you now what? Maybe life is also about not knowing. Finding the right way for us. And I can finally say outloud that it's not wrong to not find it. 

And that's my story.
