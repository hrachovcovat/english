## Abstract

This thesis focuses on changing the visual identity of a company Glamping Pyskočely. The main aim is to make united corporate identity and visual communicatuon corresponding with the company's philosophy.  Also with a new identity I would like to express the right mood of this company. By redesigning their identity I would like to spread the word 'glamping' to more people. Point out that people can experience camping in another, more comfortable way.
