## Abstract

This bachelor thesis focuses on changing the visual identity of a company Glamping Pyskočely. The work aims to make united corporate identity and visual communicatuon corresponding with the company's philosophy.  Also with a new design I would like to express the right mood of this company. By redesigning their identity I would like to spread the word 'glamping' to more people. Point out that people can experience camping in another, more comfortable way. 
The theoretical part deals with the research about creating a new corporate identity, explaining what is glamping, approximation of a history and analysis of competition. The practical part is about introducing the company and its current visual communication, marketing and a visual style.
