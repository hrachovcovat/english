### Symbols for houses
To mark individual accommodation, I decided to use symbols, which should help for better orientation. Each of the symbols shows something what dominates the style of accommodation. The symbols are inserted in an irregular wheel. It sticks to simplicity and one line.
- V korunách → This accommodation is located among the treetops, so I chose the leaves as a symbol.
- Na pláni → Teepee is the original dwelling of the Great Plains Indians, as a symbol I used the shape of the teepee, which in the end resembles Indian's patterns.
- Na pasece → On many pastures predominate rough grasses, so I decided to show them as the symbol.
- V pohodlí → Since this accommodation is mainly for families with children, I used a fire in the symbol, which refers to the phrase "warmth of home".
- Na povětří → This accommodation resembles a place where hunters observe wildlife, it is high, so I chose the wind as a symbol.

### Book for visitors
The guest book is beneficial because people write their feelings and opinions about their stay. They can write there what they missed or what they liked. The owner of the accommodation then has the opportunity to listen to his guests and thus convince his customers that he cares about them.
That is why I created a proposal for a book, which aims to connect clients with accommodation owners and thus improve the quality of services provided. The logo is burnt on wooden boards. Each accommodation would have its own book, so patterns are distinguished. The wooden boards would be painted over the pattern template, which would then remain in the original color of the wood.
