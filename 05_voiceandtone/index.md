# Voice & Tone

## Voice
I always try to act honestly and just be myself. I think that directness
is really powerful thing. During writing, presenting and in whole life.

I don't try to seem like I am a good presenter. I've never was and
never will. It's a part of myself. So everytime I present something
my aim is to not pass out, breathe and try to complete it.

## Tone

I've always enjoyed writing from essays at primary school
to e-mails or simple grocery lists. That's why I know that
it's necessary to change our voice and tone according to 
different situations and people. It gives people the idea 
of who we are and that's why it's so important.
