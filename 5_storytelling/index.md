## HI
why do I love what I do?
- honestly? I have never been a person who loves talking and talking to people, presenting oneself or their work and these things. Be known and visible. This is not what I want.
I know it is also important for this specifications but also I know it can be done without it. Every human prefers something else. I am the one who want to silently do my job.
I just want to be happy. 
- has an ability to defend oneself. And I don't have a need to do that to convince someone to like me or my work.
- So what I love about that? That it can be done almost silently. And the work can speak instead of me.

what do I believe in, what is my design philosophy?


who inspires me?
-  now I am inspirating from other's work the most. 
-  instagram or pinterent 

where does my inspiration come from?
- this is really hard question because I have had always a problem with motivation and inspiration. And cause I am still finding myself as a human, I am also still finding myslef as a graphic designer. I can't say what style I like the most or something like this. But I believe that one day I will find it.


when was that aha moment
I would be lying if I would say something like - 




set the gps (time, place, short and sweet)

experience or idea

emotions, doubt, confusion

be me 

less is more, let the audience wanting more
