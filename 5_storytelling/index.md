## HI
why do I love what I do?
- honestly? I have never been a person who loves talking and talking to people, presenting oneself or their work and these things. Be known and visible. This is not what I want.
I know it is also important for this specifications but also I know it can be done without it. Every human prefers something else. I am the one who want to silently do my job.
I just want to be happy. 
- has an ability to defend oneself. And I don't have a need to do that to convince someone to like me or my work.
- So what I love about that? That it can be done almost silently. And the work can speak instead of me.

what do I believe in, what is my design philosophy?


who inspires me?
-  now I am inspirating from other's work the most. 
-  instagram or pinterent 

where does my inspiration come from?
- this is really hard question because I have had always a problem with motivation and inspiration. And cause I am still finding myself as a human, I am also still finding myslef as a graphic designer. I can't say what style I like the most or something like this. But I believe that one day I will find it.


when was that aha moment
I would be lying if I would say something like - ??. It would be nice like that, but that's not true.


- aboutness
- In my whole life I have never been completely sure about my future. The first notification came when I had to decide what high school I want to study. Someone once told me that I have always been the person who is behind the camera, not in the viewfinder. I took it as a sign and decided to study a photography. It was a right choice because I fell in love with analog photography. Then (again) came another decision making. Somehow I started study a one year language course of english. And here we are again, after the finishing the english course the crazy sign in my head 'loading your decision...' showed up.

So now I am here, studying third and last year of graphic design at VÅ KK, telling myself what the f are u doing here. Thinking about what if I don't belong in here.

But you know what? Maybe life is about not knowing. About seeking the right way for us. And I can finally say outloud that it's not wrong to not find it, the most important is the journey.

And that's my story.

And if you are asking what am I like or what I enjoy to do. I like a book design, reading, writing, making a macrame decorations and I enjoy trying to reduce the waste I produce as a human.
