## HI
why do I love what I do?

- honestly? I have never been a person who loves talking and talking to people, presenting oneself or their work and these things. Be known and visible. This is not what I want.
I know it is also important for this specifications but also I know it can be done without it. And every human prefer something else. I am the one who want to silently do my job.
I just want to be happy. 
- 
- has an ability to defend oneself. And I don't have a need to do that to convince someone to like me or my work.

what do I believe in, what is my design philosophy
who inspires me 
where does my inspiration come from
when was that aha moment


tell it like to my friend

set the gps (time, place, short and sweet)

experience or idea

emotions, doubt, confusion

be me 

less is more, let the audience wanting more
