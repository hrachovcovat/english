# Year review
**1. What did you like most about this subject?**

I liked the fact that Justin really cared about us and was interested in us. 

**2. What did you like least about this subject?**

The first I was scared and stressed (surprisingly) about my presenting. When Justin said the word 'presentation' at the beginning of the year I thought that I won't survive this class till the end! But I am still alive.

**3. What are the top 3 things you learned this year?**

- work with GitHub
- even the English class can be fun
- and again my old sentence: That maybe I am not as useless as I thought before this class

**4. What was the most memorable activity/assignment from this year?**

Definitely the storytelling. I didn't know what to do the first, because how can someone tell a story when it is unknown to him? Finally, I made a friend out of my enemy and made fun of my lifelong trouble.

**5. What is something you accomplished this year that you are proud of?**

That I came all the way here through all the little big scarecrows in my way

**6. What is one thing you learned about yourself this year?**

That I am really good at presenting and I should make a living from it. I am kidding! :DDDD I am horrible at presenting but I don't blame myself for it, it's just me :)

**7. What is one thing you would add or change about this class?**

Everything was great :)

**8. What is one thing you could have done better this year?**

A lot of things. But this is the first time I don't blame myself for my mistakes.


**9. What is one thing I could have done better as a teacher this year?**

Nothing, I was really happy with you as a teacher. I have never had so caring, supporting and candid teacher as you.

**10. What advice would you give to students going into this subject next year?**

Don't be scared of yourself as I was (as I am :D). Be who you are and enjoy it, no one has the right to blame you for that.

## Thank you for everything, Justin!
