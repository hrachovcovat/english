## Key Points
**Background/importance of topic:** Visual identity for a project Glamping Pyskočely.

**Purpose/hypothesis (thesis or statement of problem):**
 I think the company has a big potential, but they don't use any corresponding visual style. They also 
don't use much a social media or any advert and I would like to mention what could be improved.

**Research — design/methodology/approach including procedures/data/observations:**
I was studying four competitive accommodations. Three from Czechia, two from abroad. I was concentrated on their design, communication on Instagram and Facebook, if they
use a blog or what they are using to be more visible. I also have a survey where I found out that my target group are people from 18 to 34 years and mostly partners or also families with a small children.

**Findings (highlight outcome of research):** 
?

**Conclusions (significance/success of study to theory/practical/society):**
?

# School task
## What is the problem of your thesis? 
The company don't use any corresponding visual style. They also don't use much a social media 
or any advert and I would like to mention what could be improved. Also the word 'glamping' is 
almost unknown and it would be great to introduce it to people.

## How are you going to solve it?
I was comparing competitive accommodations, mostly from Czechia, but also abroad. I was concentrated on their designs, communication on Instagram and Facebook, if they
use a blog or what they are using to be more visible. I also have a survey where I found out that my target group are people from 18 to 34 years and mostly partners or also families with a small children.

## Why do you know it will be succesful?
